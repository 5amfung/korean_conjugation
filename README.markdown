# Installation

The mobile version of dongsa.net will run directly in modern browsers. Just
open up html/index.html in your browser.

Getting the server running will require [node.js](http://nodejs.org). After
installing [npm](http://npmjs.org/) you can run run *npm install* and it will
install the required modules for you. Then you can run *node server.js* and
access the site on localhost:3000.
